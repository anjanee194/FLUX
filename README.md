# FLUX
FLUX: A Novel Filter-Based Feature Selection Method
FLUX is an innovative filter-based feature selection method that utilizes the XOR operation to identify and select significant features from datasets. It is designed to work efficiently with numerical data and binary class labels.

Usage

The function FLUX(data, k) allows you to select the top k features from your dataset. To use this function:

Ensure that the input dataset (data) contains only numerical columns.
The target/output column in your dataset must be labeled as 'Class'.
FLUX is currently designed for binary class data only and cannot handle multi-class labeled datasets in its current form.


Example

python code
# Example usage of the FLUX function
selected_features = FLUX(data, k=5)

Limitations

FLUX supports only binary classification tasks.
Multi-class datasets are not compatible with FLUX in its current implementation.
This version is more structured, includes headings for readability, and maintains a professional tone suitable for GitHub documentation. Let me know if you'd like to add further details, such as installation instructions or examples!
